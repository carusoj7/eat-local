 ## Objective
 Eat Local is a restaurant review-based application where users can view details and reviews of local restaurants. They can also add new restaurants to the list along with their overall experience.

 ## Motivation
 I created this application to provide users with a seamless and efficient experience for discovering new restaurants. With going out to eat getting more and more expensive, this application displays a platform to see genuine feedback, as well as gives users an outlet to describe their own experiences. Most importantly, I wanted to prioritize local restaurants to support the small business community.
